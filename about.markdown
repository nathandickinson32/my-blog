Hi, I’m Nathan Dickinson! I’m currently an apprentice at Clean Coders Studio. After graduating from Tech Elevator, I made the leap from over a decade in landscaping to pursue my passion for software development.

As part of this apprenticeship, I’m diving into Clojure, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and other key practices that promote clean, maintainable code. I’m excited to sharpen my skills, build meaningful projects, and document my journey along the way.

Outside of coding, I love spending time with my wife, our kitten, golfing, and fishing with my parents. This blog is where I’ll share my progress, lessons learned, and everything I pick up on the path to becoming a Craftsman.
