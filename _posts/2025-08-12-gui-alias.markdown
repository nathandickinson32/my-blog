Today I added a GUI alias to my deps.edn file so I can run:

```clojure

clj -M:gui

```

and instantly have my Tic Tac Toe graphical interface pop up.

Here’s the relevant snippet from deps.edn:

```clojure

:aliases {
          :gui {:main-opts ["-m" "tic-tac-toe.gui"]}
          }

```

This tells Clojure:
“When the user runs -M:gui, start the tic-tac-toe.gui namespace and run its
-main function.”

Clojure’s aliases are like shortcuts or “profiles” for running your project.
They can:

- Add extra dependencies
- Add extra source or test paths
- Change the program’s entry point (-main)
- Pass in special command-line options

My Other Aliases:

```clojure

:test {:extra-deps  {speclj/speclj {:mvn/version "3.10.0"}}
       :extra-paths ["spec/clj" "spec/bb" "dev"]}

:spec {:main-opts ["-m" "speclj.main" "-c"]}

:run {:main-opts ["-m" "tic-tac-toe.main"]}

```

- :test → Loads extra libraries + test files
- :spec → Runs my test suite with speclj
- :run → Runs the core game (no GUI)

No remembering the long clj -M -m tic-tac-toe.gui command. Just clj -M:gui.
Anyone looking at your deps.edn instantly knows how to run and test your project.

Adding a :gui alias might seem small, but it makes development smoother. Now I
can switch between my CLI and GUI versions in seconds without touching my code.
