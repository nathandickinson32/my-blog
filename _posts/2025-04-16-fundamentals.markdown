Kicked off today by diving back into the Clojure koans. I’m now a little over halfway through them and aiming to have the full set wrapped up by Friday. Each one continues to challenge me, but it’s rewarding to see the pieces start to come together.

One koan that stood out today was about the cond form. Unlike the usual nested if/else chains I’m used to in other languages, cond in Clojure reads more like a clean decision table. It’s elegant, with each condition and its result laid out clearly. It’s a small thing, but it really made me appreciate how readable and expressive Clojure can be when you embrace its style.

I also started watching the Clean Code Fundamentals video series. Since I’ve already listened to the audiobooks The Clean Coder and Clean Code, a lot of the material feels familiar, which definitely helps. Uncle Bob’s energy and clarity really come through in the videos. He makes it easier to stay focused and absorb the content.

Overall today felt productive and motivating. Looking forward to seeing what I can knock out tomorrow.
