Today I worked on adding a 3x3x3 board option for my tic tac toe game. I
started the same way I built out the 3x3 and 4x4 boards, by formatting the
board first. This time, I wrote a function to doseq through each layer now
that im printing multiple layers.

After that, I followed the same general flow I used before: generate available
positions, make a move, then check for wins. Today I just worked on a 2D level
across the 3D board. Felt good to build off patterns I already had in place.
Another solid day getting more comfortable navigating this codebase and
using the tools I've built already.

Hereâ€™s what I wrote to see if any layer has a winning row:

```clojure
(defn winning-row-3d? [board token]
  (some #(winning-row-2d? % token) board))

```

I did similar functions for columns and diagonals using the (some) function to 
map through each layer.

A great Monday here at Clean Coders!
