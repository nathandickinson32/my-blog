Today I practiced my Langton’s Ant kata a few more times before presenting it
at our lunch and learn. The presentation went really well! The main piece of
feedback I got was about possibly adding a helper function to clean up some
repetitive test setup. A small refactor, but great point.

After that, I got to work making my expert AI work on a 3x3x3 board for my
tic-tac-toe game. I thought limiting the depth might be enough to avoid
crashing, but that didn’t solve it. I also tried adding some heuristics and
even removed memoization in case memory was the issue... still no luck.

I’ve reached out for some help, and I’m hoping to hit the ground running on
a fix first thing next week.

TDD, presenting, debugging... Today had it all!
