Today I finished my presentation slides on the
Single Responsibility Principle. I’m feeling
good about where I landed with it. After
spending some time with examples like Batman’s
belt, the concept is clicking more clearly for
me, one thing does one job, and does it well.

I also paired up with my mentor to work through
Euler Problem 4. It’s always cool to watch someone
more experienced walk through a problem but still
explain it at a level I can follow. We’re putting
a lot of value on the speed of our test cycles, 
keeping things fast and focused.

Solid progress today on both the talking and
the coding side.
