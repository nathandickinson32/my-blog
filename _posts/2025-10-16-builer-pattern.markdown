Today I worked on my presentation for the Builder pattern. Like the other
design patterns I’ve been studying, I used the Gang of Four’s Design Patterns
book as my main reference, then tried to come up with a clear, real-world way
to explain it. For this one, I used a car factory as the analogy.

The idea behind the Builder pattern is to separate the construction of a complex
object from its representation. In other words, it’s about having a clear
process for how something is built, without tying it directly to what is being
built.

In my example, the director is like the factory manager who knows the order of
steps to build a car: frame, engine, paint, interior, and so on. The builder
handles the actual details of each step, and you can have different builders for
different types of cars like a sports car builder or an SUV builder.

By separating the construction steps from the final product, you make it easy to
create different variations without changing the core building process.

Putting the presentation together helped me see how the Builder pattern fits
into the broader theme of flexibility and reusability that keeps showing up in
these design patterns.
