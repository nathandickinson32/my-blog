Today I started digging into my next presentation
on the SOLID principles, this time focusing on the
Open/Closed Principle (OCP). The idea that code
should be open to extension but closed to
modification is starting to make more sense the
more examples I look at.

I watched Uncle Bob’s video on OCP today, which
helped me start to see how this principle shows
up in everyday design decisions. I’m planning to
use a hand mixer as my real-world example, it’s a
simple device, but the way it can take on different
attachments without needing to be redesigned is a
nice way to illustrate OCP in action.

Now I’m gathering ideas and working to build out a
presentation that feels clear and practical. I want
to keep it beginner-friendly, but still show how
powerful the principle is when it’s applied well.
