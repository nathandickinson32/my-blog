Today I paired with my mentor to implement a Babashka script into my Tic Tac
Toe project! I’ve always been interested in setting up databases, and this gave
me a great excuse to explore a new tool while practicing that.

What is Babashka?

Babashka is a fast starting Clojure scripting runtime that lets you run Clojure
scripts with a focus on tooling and scripting tasks. This is perfect for CLIs or
automation. We used it to create a script that can start up a database in a
PostgreSQL with one command.

Setting Up

# Create a bb.edn file

```clojure

{:paths ["dev"]
 :deps  {tic_tac_toe/tic_tac_toe {:local/root "."}}
 :pods  {org.babashka/postgresql {:version "0.1.0"}}
 :tasks {create-db {:doc      "Initializes the SQL Database"
                    :requires ([tic-tac-toe.create-db :as create-db])
                    :task     (create-db/-main)}
         spec      {:extra-paths ["spec/bb"]
                    :extra-deps  {speclj/speclj {:mvn/version "3.10.0"}}
                    :requires    ([speclj.main :as main])
                    :task        (apply main/-main "-c" "spec/bb" *command-line-args*)}}
 }

```

# Create a namespace for script code and include this at the top

```clojure

#!/usr/bin/env bb

(ns tic-tac-toe.create-db
    (:require [tic-tac-toe.config :as config]
      [pod.babashka.postgresql :as db]))

```

1. #!/usr/bin/env bb
2. This tells your terminal to run the script using Babashka.
3. (ns tic-tac-toe.create-db ...)
4. connection info like database name, user, and password.
5. :require includes:

- tic-tac-toe.config: This is where I keep my db-spec, the map that holds
   connection info like database name, user, and password.
- pod.babashka.postgresql: This what lets Babashka talk to
   PostgreSQL

This connection setup is the foundation for automating tasks like creating
tables, seeding test data, or even resetting the DB if needed.

This was my first time using Babashka pods, and I’m excited to keep going.
Tomorrow I’ll share how I used this connection to create the actual table
schema.
