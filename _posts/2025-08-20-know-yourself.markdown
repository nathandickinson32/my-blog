Last Wednesday during IPM I went through the process of estimating my stories
for the new iteration. After sharing my initial estimates, my mentors
intentionally questioned me about the size of those estimates and applied
pressure to see how I would respond.

I gave in to that pressure and re-estimated much lower than I should have. The
result was that I wasnâ€™t able to deliver everything I committed to, and I left
the iteration feeling horrible about it.

This experience taught me something important: estimates are about honesty, 
not optimism. If I underestimate just to appease others, the only outcome is
missed commitments and frustration. I need to trust my instincts, give the 
estimates that I believe are realistic, and stand by them. That way I can
deliver on time and keep the trust of my team.
