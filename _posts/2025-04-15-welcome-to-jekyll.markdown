I’ve officially started my apprenticeship with Clean Coders! While I’m currently waiting on my company laptop to arrive so I can finish onboarding, I’ve been making the most of the downtime. I’ve started working through Clojure koans on my personal laptop and have begun building this blog site to document my journey.
