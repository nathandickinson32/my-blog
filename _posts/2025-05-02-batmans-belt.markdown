Today I worked on preparing two presentations:
a video recording of my Bowling Game Kata,
and a talk on the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

For the SRP talk, my favorite metaphor so far is Batman’s belt.
The belt itself has one job, to hold tools. It doesn’t care
what those tools do or how they work. You can change the
Batarang, replace the grappling hook, or upgrade the smoke
pellets, and none of it affects the belt or the other items
that are in the belt. That’s SRP. Each piece does one thing
and does it well, making it easier to update and
maintain without creating a domino effect.

I’m still refining both presentations, but it’s been
a fun way to dig deeper into the ideas and make sure
I can explain them clearly.
