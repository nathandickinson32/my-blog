Today I had my IPM to go over my progress on the
Euler problems. My early work was solid, but then
I started pulling in algorithms I found online to get
things working. That’s not the right approach. I need to
stick with the skills I have and use TDD to uncover
where I struggle and where I succeed.

It’s important that I know exactly how my code works, not
just that it works. I need to understand why it’s
written the way it is, line by line. So I’ll be diving
deeper into the Clojure docs and trying to shift my 
thinking away from my object-oriented Java habits. 
One big goal is to get better at writing
effective recursion.

That said, I also moved on to learning about the Single
Responsibility Principle by watching Episode 9 of the
Clean Coders series. It was a good reminder that clean 
code is not just about working solutions, but about
structure and intent.
