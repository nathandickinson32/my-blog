Today I just about wrapped up my presentation
on the Open/Closed Principle. The more time
I spend with it, the more I see how it
connects with the TDD process. Starting can
feel a little slow, writing those small,
isolated tests and resisting the urge to just
jump into code, but sticking with it leads to
a design that’s easier to extend without needing
to constantly rewrite what already works.

I also spent time watching Uncle Bob’s video
on the Liskov Substitution Principle. It’s 
definitely a more abstract one, but the examples
helped me see why respecting behavior in
subclasses matters when building something
that’s meant to last.

Looking forward to presenting OCP soon and
starting to dig deeper into LSP.
