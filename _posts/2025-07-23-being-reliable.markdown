Today I focused on cleaning up my code and adding tests to get closer to 100%
coverage before IPM. But once again, I fell short of completing my iteration.

I’ve gotten into a bad habit of underestimating stories and working myself
down to the wire. Every week hoping to just barely get things done. The issue
is, I don’t want to turn in work that falls short of the quality I know I can
deliver. But the trade-off has been missed estimates and late completions.

Today, I had to have a tough but important conversation with my mentors about
trust. They need to be able to count on me to deliver what I commit to. No
more explaining failures at the end of the week. They were right to bring this
up and I need to do better.

They reminded me that it’s okay to finish early. That there’s value in having
time to clean things up, explore solutions more deeply, or even sometimes, take
a breath. Moments later, I estimated my next iteration, and still
underestimated slightly. I hadn’t fully absorbed the lesson yet.

But now that I’ve had time to digest the information, I get it (I hope). I
think they know I work hard, care deeply, and always communicate. But now I
need to be reliable. Deliver every week and deliver well. An old estimating
phrase in landscaping, and I'm sure other industries, was "Under Promise and
Over Deliver".

A big focus at Clean Coders is balance. I think this was their way of reminding
me to honor that and get back to some of my life, too.
