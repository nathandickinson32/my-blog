I’ve just wrapped up my second day at Clean Coders Studio and I’m feeling great!
Today was all about building momentum. I finished setting up my blog site, learned the
ins and outs of Jekyll and got a taste for how to customize themes within Jekyll pages.
The site is now live and hosted with GitHub Pages!

I also made more progress on the Clojure koans, continuing to work through them while
jotting down notes to help things stick. Toward the end of the day, I got set up to dive
into the Fundamentals series and begin tackling the exams.
