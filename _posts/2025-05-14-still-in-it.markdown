Today I worked on Euler Problem 8 and had my IPM.
Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m underperforming
when it comes to using the core Clojure tools, 
simple things like map, loop, and recur. A lot
of my solutions are being built with functions
I don’t fully understand yet, like partition or
lazy-seq, and it’s tough to reason through what’s
really happening under the hood.

It’s frustrating to feel overwhelmed and behind,
especially when I’m still trying hard. But I know
that struggling with something is often a sign that
real learning is happening. I want to get to a place
where I’m writing solutions I completely understand,
from start to finish, even if they’re not the fastest
or most elegant. For now, I’m trying to stay patient,
ask good questions, and keep showing up.
