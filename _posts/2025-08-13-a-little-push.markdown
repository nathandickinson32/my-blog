Today was our Iteration Planning Meeting. I was able to deliver everything I
committed to in the last sprint, which felt great. After that, I estimated my
new stories for the upcoming work.

At first, I estimated conservatively. Honestly, the reason was simple: I wanted
to be 100% sure I could deliver on time. But during discussion, I was asked why
my estimates were longer than expected, and I was told I wasnâ€™t performing as
strongly as the other apprentices.

That stung a little, but it was also good feedback. Instead of shying away, I
re-estimated my stories with a more aggressive mindset, deciding to push myself
further this time.
