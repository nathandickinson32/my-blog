Today I worked on putting together my video presentation for Langton’s Ant. I
decided to try something new and use Canva instead of iMovie. Canva offers a
few creative tools and layout options I hadn’t played with before.

Rookie mistake... I built out the entire presentation without saving or
double-checking if my videos uploaded properly. Well… they were not. By the
time I was ready to save, I realized the uploads had broken, and all the slides
I had worked on that used those clips were now useless

Deep Breath.

Next Problem.

I moved my ideas over to iMovie and got back to work. I took out a few pieces
I had hoped would bring a little extra something to this presentation due
to time restraints. It was frustrating, but I’m still really happy with how it
turned out.

I've got to remember to research new tools and constantly be saving and checking
my work.

Lessons Learned!
